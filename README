For task one.
=============

Please Uncomment code from peer1.py as
# UnComment this for Task1
for x in range(1, 61):
    global local_rfc_list
    title = "RFC %s About something" % x
    RFC = RFCs(x, title, ['127.0.0.1', port_server])
    local_rfc_list.append(RFC)

Note: Make sure you don't have below lines in any peers:
# This is required for Task2
for x in range(1, 11):
    global local_rfc_list
    title = "RFC %s About something" % x
    RFC = RFCs(x, title, ['127.0.0.1', port_server])
    local_rfc_list.append(RFC)


Now, Copy all the RFCs to peers/peer1rfcs folder. and make sure your don't have anything in peers/peer2rfcs, peers/peer3rfcs, peers/peer4rfcs, peers/peer5rfcs, peers/peer6rfcs folders

Run the system:
    Please run RS server and peers ( peer1, peer2, peer3, peer4, peer5, peer6)
    1. run RS server using "python rs_server.py"
    2. run peers like "python peer1.py" "python peer2.py" and so on .. on different terminals.
    3. It is a interactive application, so please beer with us and choose the below options.
        a. Enter 1 for Registering your peer in RS

Once all the peers are registered. Please do following on peer2, peer3, peer4, peer5, peer6
    Enter 3 for Just PQuery from RS Server:
    Enter 4 for Just RFCQuery from Active Peers:

Now all the peers peer2, peer3, peer4, peer5, peer6 will have all the RFCs from all the ACtive peers.

To Download the 50 RFCs on peer2, peer3, peer4, peer5, peer6, please do following:
    Enter 5 for All downloading the RFCs:

you will see for example:
Time Taken to download one file is  0.0318076187175 -> time take to download one RFC file.
Count :  1 -> no. of files that have been downloaded so far.
cumulative time taken:  0.0318076187175 -> cumulative time to download files so far

TASK ONE IS COMPLETE.
peers/peer2rfcs, peers/peer3rfcs, peers/peer4rfcs, peers/peer5rfcs, peers/peer6rfcs folders will have all 60 Peers from Peer1 :)

For task two.
=============

Please Uncomment code from peer1.py as
# Comment this for Task1
for x in range(1, 61):
    global local_rfc_list
    title = "RFC %s About something" % x
    RFC = RFCs(x, title, ['127.0.0.1', port_server])
    local_rfc_list.append(RFC)

Note: Make sure you have below lines in all peers which has statment :" This is required for Task2 "

# This is required for Task2
for x in range(1, 11):
    global local_rfc_list
    title = "RFC %s About something" % x
    RFC = RFCs(x, title, ['127.0.0.1', port_server])
    local_rfc_list.append(RFC)


Now, Copy 10 RFCs to peers/peer1rfcs folder. & do the same for peers/peer2rfcs, peers/peer3rfcs, peers/peer4rfcs, peers/peer5rfcs, peers/peer6rfcs folders

Run the system:
    Please run RS server and peers ( peer1, peer2, peer3, peer4, peer5, peer6)
    1. run RS server using "python rs_server.py"
    2. run peers like "python peer1.py" "python peer2.py" and so on .. on different terminals.
    3. It is a interactive application, so please beer with us and choose the below options.

Once all the peers are registered. Please do following on peer1, peer2, peer3, peer4, peer5, peer6
    Enter 3 for Just PQuery from RS Server:
    Enter 4 for Just RFCQuery from Active Peers:

Now all the peers : peer1, peer2, peer3, peer4, peer5, peer6 will have all the RFCs from all the ACtive peers.

To Download the 50 RFCs on peer1, peer2, peer3, peer4, peer5, peer6, please do following:
    Enter 5 for All downloading the RFCs:

you will see for example:

TASK TWO IS COMPLETE
peers/peer2rfcs, peers/peer2rfcs, peers/peer3rfcs, peers/peer4rfcs, peers/peer5rfcs, peers/peer6rfcs folders will have all 60 Peers
